## Introduction 

The project, titled "Food Donation Application," introduces ShareCare, a mobile app designed to address Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) concerning zero hunger. ShareCare focuses on efficiently distributing excess food resources to combat both food waste and hunger. Recognizing the pressing issue of food waste, ShareCare serves as a strategic solution, allowing users to easily contribute food donations to those in need. By using ShareCare, we can reduce food waste and make sure that the less fortunate get good, nutritious food. The app also works with local businesses, and it teaches people about the importance of not wasting food. ShareCare is a friendly and practical way to make a positive difference in our community by sharing our extra food resources.

## Problem Statement
In today's modern society, there's a big problem with lots of food being thrown away, and not everyone has enough to eat. Even though there's extra food from places like restaurants and stores, a lot of it gets wasted, causing environmental issues and making hunger and not having enough food even worse. At the same time, individuals or groups willing to donate find it challenging to connect with those in need. This situation shows that there's a real need for an innovative solution to bring together those who have extra food and those who could use it while addressing the broader issues of food waste and hunger.

## Objectives
1. To define the requirements for developing the Food donation Application.
2. To develop the Food Donation Application to help those in need.
3. To test the mobile app’s ability to maximize the application's impact on reducing food waste and aiding those in need
